# Melanoma_Detection_Assignment

Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. 
So, as a part of this project, we will build a CNN model which can accurately detect melanoma.

## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
  -> Melanoma is a type of skin cancer which leads to many deaths around the globe. The purpose of this project is to develop a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)        model which can help in early detection of the disease and thus preventive actions can be taken. 
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  -> The project has a potential to make early detections in Melanoma thus can be widely used by dermatologists and skin cancer specialists. They can take help     
     from this project to make decisions and diagonsis if required. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  -> The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).       All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of          melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


  The data set contains the following diseases:

  Actinic keratosis
  Basal cell carcinoma
  Dermatofibroma
  Melanoma
  Nevus
  Pigmented benign keratosis
  Seborrheic keratosis
  Squamous cell carcinoma
  Vascular lesion
